            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hey there, I'm from Yerevan, Armenia, born and raised here. It's a great city, full of culture and history. I don't really know much about my family history, but I'm pretty sure my ancestors are Armenian, like most people here.
                <br />
                <br />
                So, even though I'm currently studying architecture, I've been interested in programming since I was a child. I remember being fascinated by the way computers worked and how you could make them do things just by typing a few lines of code. I used to spend hours on my computer, tinkering with different programming languages and experimenting with different software.
                <br />
                <br />
                Even though I'm not studying computer science, I still try to keep up with the latest trends and technologies in programming.I also like to read books and watch movies, and I play the piano in my free time. It's a great way to unwind and express myself creatively.
                <br />
                <br />
                I don't really have any important issues in my life right now. I'm just focused on my studies and my hobbies. In the future, I want to become a cyber security or white hacker, and I want to travel around the world. There's so much to see and explore, and I want to experience as much of it as I can.
                <br />
                <br />
                Overall, I'm just a regular person with a passion for technology and a love of adventure. I hope that I can make a difference in the world someday, and I'm excited to see where life takes me.
